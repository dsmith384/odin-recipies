    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna is the perfect balance of savory, cheesy, and rich flavors. Layers of perfectly cooked
        lasagna noodles are sandwiched between a hearty homemade meat sauce and a creamy, cheesy filling that's
        melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The sauce, made with ground beef, onions, garlic, and marinara, is simmered to
        perfection and seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil for a comforting, savory base.
    </p>
    <p>The cheese filling combines rich ricotta, gooey mozzarella, and sharp Parmesan, along with a touch of egg and
        fresh
        parsley for added flavor. Topped off with more mozzarella and Parmesan, the lasagna bakes to a golden, bubbly
        perfection. Each bite delivers a satisfying mix of tender noodles, flavorful sauce, and creamy cheese that's
        absolutely
        irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>Whether you're serving it for a family dinner or a special occasion, this lasagna is sure to please a crowd with
        its layers of comfort and indulgence. Perfect for making ahead, it's even better the next day when the flavors
