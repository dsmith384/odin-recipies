    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Caesar salad is a crisp, refreshing salad known for its creamy, tangy dressing made with anchovies, garlic, lemon
        juice,
        and Parmesan cheese. Traditionally served with crunchy croutons and romaine lettuce, it's a staple in
        restaurants and
        easy to make at home. You can also top it with grilled chicken or shrimp for a heartier meal.
