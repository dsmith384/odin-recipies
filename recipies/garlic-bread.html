    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic bread is a classic, savory side dish made from toasted bread, generously topped with a mixture of butter,
        garlic,
        and herbs. The result is a deliciously crispy and aromatic treat that pairs wonderfully with pastas, salads, and
        soups.
        It's a simple yet irresistible dish that can be made in under 30 minutes, making it perfect for both casual and
        special
        meals.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves, minced (or 1-2 tsp garlic powder)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (or 1 tsp dried parsley)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for extra heat</li>
        <li>1 loaf of Italian or French bread (sliced in half horizontally)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Slice the loaf of bread horizontally (or leave it whole for a pull-apart style). Spread a generous layer of
            garlic butter on the cut sides.</li>
        <li>Place the bread halves on a baking sheet, cut side up, and bake for 10–12 minutes, until golden and crispy
            on
            the edges.</li>
        <li>If using, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top of the bread during the last 2 minutes of baking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, slice, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
